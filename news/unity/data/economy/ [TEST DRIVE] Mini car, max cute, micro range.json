{"it": " [TEST DRIVE] Mini car, max cute, micro range |   The Mini Cooper SE electric vehicles [BMW KOREA]     Koreans are said to have a disinclination toward smaller vehicles. BMW is doing its best to change that with the simply adorable Mini Cooper SE.      The company might have some luck, as the three-door hatchback electric vehicle (EV) is a real pip. BMW would probably do even better if the little Mini had a bit more range.      The Mini Cooper SE is the first all-electric EV under the Mini brand. The British automaker plans to go all-EV by the early 2030s.    The Korea JoongAng Daily recently took the cute-as-a-button EV on a 35-kilometer (22-mile) spin around Seoul, passing the exhibition center in Gangnam, southern Seoul, and stopping for a spot of brunch at a cafe in Seongdong District, eastern Seoul. The test-driving course was quite unique as the Mini Electric is most suitable for city driving, the company said.    The exterior of the Mini Electric is little changed from previous Minis. But the  energetic yellow  — added to its side mirrors, emblems, and interior panels — stood out.    The vehicle is only 3,850 millimeters (152 inches) long, 1,725 millimeters wide, and 1,430 millimeters high, and that is abundantly clear on the inside. The back seat was even a bit too cramped for this 5-foot-3-inch reporter, unless the front seat is moved forward. The truck storage capacity is 211 liters (56 gallons) and expands to 731 liters when the back seats are folded down.    Cornering and parking were very easy even on the narrow alleys of Seoul due to the small size. The noise was barely noticeable.    The one-pedal driving system was especially convenient as it allowed the driver to use one pedal to accelerate and decelerate the vehicle. When easing up off the pedal, the car slowed down on its own and came to a complete stop.      It felt like safety was guaranteed, as the car alerted the driver when veering into another lane.    With a maximum of 184 horsepower and 27.5 kilogram-meters of torque, the little hatchback only takes 7.3 seconds to reach 100 kilometers per hour.    Rough roads were not particularly fun in the Mini. This reporter never felt motion sickness while driving any other cars but felt carsick for the first time driving this EV.      The back of the Mini Electric [BMW KOREA]     The infotainment system was quite disappointing, and the navigation system underwhelmed in a market where the feature is highly developed and a key sales point.      Driving range was the big disappointment for this little runabout. Equipped with a 32.6-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery, the Mini Cooper SE can only travel 159 kilometers per charge, according to Korea s Ministry of Environment.    That range is not even half that of the latest EVs and even shorter than other small EVs currently available in Korea, such as Renault s Zoe compact EV and Peugeot e-208.    The Zoe can go 309 kilometers per charge, while Peugeot e-208 can travel 244 kilometers. They have been slammed by critics for their limited ranges, but they are better in that respect than the Mini.      BMW Korea said despite the short driving range, the charging speed is fast, taking around 35 minutes to hit 80 percent using a rapid charger.    The EV is available in two versions, Classic and Electric depending on the functionality.    The sticker price of Mini Cooper SE starts at 45.6 million won ($36,800). Despite the cheap price, buyers are only able to receive 82 percent of the government s subsidy due to the short driving range. Customers in Seoul will pay a net of around 38 million won.    In cities like Jeonju, North Jeolla, which offer higher subsidies, people can get the vehicle for a little more than 33 million won.    BMW Korea started taking orders for the Mini Electrics on Jan. 11. It has already received 700 orders, which is around 90 percent of its target for the year.  |https://news.naver.com/main/read.naver?mode=LS2D&mid=shm&sid1=101&sid2=263&oid=640&aid=0000022383"}
